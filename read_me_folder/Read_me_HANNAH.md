What means 'HACKING' to me (first thoughts before the practice) 

Hacking to me, reminds me of hacking a system. For example a daily routine. Our lifestyles are changing rapidly throughout different timeframes, this has to do with the fact that there are a lot of changes. Take your mobile phone, it is already part
of a changed daily routine. Where we first had to make a call with a telephone book, we are now connected to everyone, 
everywhere.

- Inspection tools 

I brought my phone as a inspection tool. 
We had to inspect the inspection tool. 

Describe the object from your point of view; what are its performative qualities and affordances; in which context can it be 
used? How can you use it as an inspection / intervention tool? 
Describe the object from the point of view of the object; build a small glossary for the object - “as if it would speak and 
have a language of its own”’ you can look into references and find “members of the same family”. 

OBJECT = My telephone 

My telephone can be used in a social context, it is a tool to communicate with others. I can also use my phone to search for information on the internet. I can make pictures with it, and videos, by that, record sound and documentate it immediately. 
I can use my phone to look at the time, it is a machine which brings me to reality, even though it is a ‘machine’. It is a 
wireless thing which can be with or without me. With me it has extra data, without me it is just ‘a phone’. The phone has got 
a lot of information on it, such as contacts, photos and other media. The phone is a box and the data is within it. Without 
the data my phone is just a box, but still with many possibilities. 
"I am iPhone van Hannah van den Elzen, I am iPhone number 7 and I have a body which can grow 128 GB big. You can feed me 
with loads of personal data. I can hold your photo’s, your contacts, your messages, your social life actually. 
This makes me your diary, as well. You can feed me and feed me. Feed me till I weigh 128 GB. But, if you give me too much food,
I can’t hold it, I will spit it out then. There goes your social life…. You cry and you cry, because you lost your persona. 
But maybe this makes you realise, that you have to be careful with me: I am a part of your personality. When I suddenly die, 
a part of YOU dies as well. Unless you cheat on me and you have your information stored on an other device as well, 
from my point of view, do you think I am not good enough? Not big enough? I can’t eat that much you want me to? 
Don’t over estimate me girl… I am just a phone…. MY body, not YOURS”

(In a relationship with a phone, you give everything to the phone, your personal information, because you trust the phone. 
Sometimes the phone, just as in a human relationship, cheats on you. It gives your information, your nudes for example, 
to one another. But you as phone user can also cheat, you can use Facebook, Instagram or another organisation to give them 
your photos. But the phone thought, the photos were only for me?) 

hahaha echt niet
kom chatten

send nudes

ok ;)

OBJECT = Keys

Keys can be used to open a door. A backdoor, a front door, the door from your room. Keys can also be used for a bike, or an 
other public transport use. As well, keys can be used if you want to protect yourself. A key is sharp. A key is unique, every 
door has got a different key. A key can also be used for a locker, to hide something. A key is only for you. A key is a 
connection to a ‘diary’ as well. It is personal. Do you want to give your keys to anyone else? A key is there to hide something. You hold your keys close to you, don’t want to loose them. 
I am a key. Connected to my ‘key family’. I am the key of your front door. Your front door is connected to your home, 
a place where are your personal belongings are stored. A place in which you sleep, you dress, you shower. You meet other 
people in your place and you have loads of memories in your home. Where would your home be without me? I am literally the 
‘KEY’ to your personal life. Hold me close, if you loose me, it is getting hard to get into your home. Or you have to break 
in, as a criminal. Then there developed a lot of distance, between you and your home. I, the key, I am easy. I am a tool. 
You can use me. You can use me to hold me to yourself. I AM TRAPPED. Maybe I don’t want to be the key of YOUR room, I want to 
be the key to a house with swimming pool, cinema. Or maybe I want to be the key to a candy store? I have nothing to say in 
this. I was born this way. I can’t change myself. But YOU can change me. If you change your home, or if you take me with you 
on your journeys. If you give me to someone else, my life will in the same house over and over again…..
